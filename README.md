# GeoQuiz

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-iOS-blue.svg)

This is an implementation of GeoQuiz, the starter project in the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

## Known Issues

- When running in the simulator, Xcode displays a warning because voice assets for the different languages are not available. This could be solved by automatically downloading the voices or providing a button/flow that lets users download them.
